        If you use public transportation in Seattle, you’ve probably noticed that bus stop “arrival" times don't always match reality. Most public transit tools still rely on inflexible schedules instead of live GPS data. Seattle planned to install hundreds of real-time arrival displays to upgrade its bus stops. Four years later, we only have 17.
        I wanted to see if I could build my own. This is the MiniBusBoard—a $16 display that works for any bus stop in Puget Sound.
        Powered by an ESP32, OneBusAway, and AWS serverless architecture, it shows you real-time data so you know when your bus is actually arriving—not just when it's scheduled to.
